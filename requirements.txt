steps:

1)sudo apt install python3-pip git unzip 
2)pip3 install esptool(for this tool to work we need to work with virtual environment)
By adding espenv, you are automating the configuration process for the ESP8266/ESP32 environment, so you donâ€™t have to manually set environment variables like PATH, ESPPORT, ESPTOOL, etc., each time you work with the microcontroller. It helps make the development process more seamless
                     
3) Download deauther firmware
   https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther
   Download the .bin file for your board,
   for example: ESP8266_DEAUTHER-1.6.5-NodeMCU.bin
4)Connect and Use the Deauther

Unplug and replug the ESP8266.

It will create a Wi-Fi access point, usually called pwned or Deauther. Connect to it from another device (phone/laptop).
